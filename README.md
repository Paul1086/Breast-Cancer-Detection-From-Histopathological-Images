# Breast Cancer Detection with Classic CNNs

Detected breast tumors from BreakHis dataset using Classic CNN architectures (LeNet-5, AlexNet,  and VGG-16). The dataset consists of microscopic biopsy images of benign and malignant breast tumors. LeNet-5 and AlexNet were trained from scratch and VGG16 was applied by using the concept of transfer learning.

## Platform and Tools:
Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

## Results: 
VGG-16 provided the best performance in detecting the malignant tumors with a validation accuracy of 0.92, precision 0.99, recall 0.95, and f1 score of 0.89.
